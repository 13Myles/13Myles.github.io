  <h1>Ethics of Information Technology</h1>
  <p>&#x2022; Information Technology (IT) - involves the use of computers, storage systems, networks, and other physical devices, infrastructure, and processes to manage, process, store, secure, and exchange electronic data. IT is primarily associated with business operations rather than personal or entertainment applications. Its commercial scope includes both computing technologies and telecommunications.</p>
  
  <h1>Ethics of Cybersecurity</h1>
  <p>&#x2022; As the digital world continues to evolve, the importance of cybersecurity ethics grows significantly. Cybersecurity professionals are on the front lines defending against increasingly sophisticated threats. Understanding the ethical implications of their work is crucial, as they balance security measures with societal values. While advancements in technology have enhanced security capabilities, cybercriminals are continually finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities. For example, phishing attacks, which have been around since the 1990s, remain one of the most common and damaging forms of cybercrime, with mobile phishing reaching a peak in 2022 and causing billions in losses. Cybersecurity ethics provides professionals with a framework for making ethical decisions in a digital environment. Ethics distinguishes cybersecurity professionals from cybercriminals; while hackers steal and misuse data, cybersecurity experts use their knowledge to protect it. Ethical principles guide cybersecurity professionals in identifying harmful behaviors online, ensuring that their actions promote safety and trust in the digital world. The importance of cybersecurity cannot be overstated, as it plays a critical role in safeguarding sensitive data and protecting individuals and organizations from financial fraud, identity theft, and other cybercrimes. For example, secure online banking relies on robust cybersecurity measures to protect customers' financial information. A breach not only puts personal data at risk but can also disrupt business operations, impact customers, and even jeopardize public infrastructure. In sensitive environments like hospitals, cyberattacks can have severe consequences on people's health and well-being, making cybersecurity an essential aspect of modern life</p>
